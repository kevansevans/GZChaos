GZChaos 1.1

General changes:
	- GZDoom 4.11 now required!
	- Massively overhauled underlying system. Technically GZChaos 2.0, but that's for later, maybe.
	- Seed system is no longer weird janky self implemented p_random nonsense.
	- Every effect has had their code refactored and cleaned up, should perform much smoother.
	- Timer code has been refactored to be more flexible and stable.
	- Effects that are timer based can now stack on each other. 2x can combine with 4x to make 8x.
	- Effects that could not carry across a level change now carry across a level change. No I will not elaborate.
	- Texture swap effects have been reduced from 5 minutes to 2 minutes.
	- Shader effects have had their duration reduced to 1 minute.
	- Effects that downgrade health pickups will no longer target soulpshere or megaspheres.
	- Fixed crashes pertaining to effects classified as "Room clearing".
	- Fixed several freezes pertaining to while loops.
	- Added "Pink" as a timer bar color.
	- Added "Water" as a timer bar texture.
	- Removed main menu addition, GZChaos options can still be found in the options menu.
	- Added a menu to enable/disable effects in settings.
	- Effect frequency can now be set to 3 minutes.
	- Removed effect time flux settings.
	
Specific effect changes:
	- "On A Roll" now affects all actors, except player.
	- "Doom for the SNES" now affects all actors. For the rare cases a decorative actor has rotation frames.
	- "Hidden Timer and Effects" have been split in twain.
	- "Recording/Rewinding" will now factor in player pitch.
	- "Clear Auto Map" has changed to "Faulty automap". Automap will only show lines in player's view.
	- "Give a random item" will give ANY inventory item loaded in, regardless if it's useful or not.
	- "Give a random weapon" will give ANY weapon loaded in, regardless if it's useful or not.
	- "Mitosis" properly separates enemies.
	- "Arachnotron growth spurt" will now check if there are arachnotrons on the map to force into puberty.
	- "Bouncy! Bouncy! Bouncy!" will reset all projectiles back to their default state when finished.

New Effects:
	- 1/3rd timer
	- 1/10th timer
	- 3x timer
	- Vibin on the cybin
	- Friendly Archviles
	- It's an abstract kind of hell
	- Pause timer
	- Get the lead out!
	- 2x effect speed
	- 0.5x effect speed
	- You are the horror
	- Diabolist Curse
	
Notes:
	Part of the underlying changes include a "purity" detection system. A ton of
	effects I wanted implemented could not happen due my desires to keep the game
	as "uber compatible" as possible. So a bit of underlying code is set up to
	check for these things, let me know if there's any weird behavior when mixing
	GZChaos with various weapon mods. Not that I recommend it for the usual reasons.
	This version does not feature any effect that relies on this system, this is just
	to test that the refactor didn't make things shit the bed.
