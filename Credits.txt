In general, many thanks to the Mad Hellforge crew for joining me along in the VC's
I streamed development on, pitching their ideas, their feedback, and their
frustrated enjoyment as they play tested. Thanks guys!

Thank you to the many helpful people over in the ZDoom discord that helped me
with my many problems I had while I was making this.
